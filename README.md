# CS634 Final Term Project - Emily Pham
This project implements and evaluates three classification algorithms on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset:

- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## Files
- `finaltermproj_notebook.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all code and results
- `breast_cancer_data.csv` – Dataset used for classification
- `rf_results.csv`, `knn_results.csv`, `lstm_results.csv` – Per-fold and average metrics
- `finaltermproj.py` – Python source code

## Instructions to Run
1. Install required packages
2. Open `finaltermproj_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run all cells in order to reproduce results and metrics
